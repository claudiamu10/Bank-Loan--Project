# Bank-Loan--Project
Universal Bank is looking to predict an important class( Non- Personal Loan) to guide strategic decisions within the Marketing and Finance Departments. The model used in this project is Neural Network with SDG Optimizer, which is a good starting point. However, it could be improved moving forward for better performance particularly knowing that the Bank would prefer Recall Score to be maximized. 
A higher Recall score is crucial as it helps to minimize false Negatives. 
Hence, the goal is on increasing Recall Score which directly translates to fewer missed opportunities(False Negatives). By identifying the True Positive(i.e. Class 0), the bank can refine its Marketing strategies to convince more customers to accept Personal Loan Offers, thereby increasing Revenue.
